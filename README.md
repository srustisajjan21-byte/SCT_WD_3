## 💡 How the Application Works

- Questions are stored in a JavaScript array.
- Each question has a type:
  - `single` → Radio buttons
  - `multi` → Checkboxes
  - `fill` → Text input
- JavaScript dynamically renders each question.
- Answers are validated when the user clicks **Next**.
- Final score is displayed after completing all questions.
